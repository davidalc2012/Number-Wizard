# Number-Wizard
Game console created in Unity

My first console game using Unity based on the www.udemy.com course: "Learn to Code by Making Games -  The Complete Unity Developer Course".
The objective of the game is to guess a number thinked by the gamer between a preset range of numbers (1-1000)
usign a simple version of a binary search and waiting for the user response to set the next guessing.
